<p>Hey Everyone, welcome to my blog. I’ll be posting things that I think are cool, this will include summarizing cool machine learning or theoretical computer science and when applicable an in browser demo of the results. Sometimes I’ll also post my personal opinions on tech and philosophy. I’m still learning how Jekyll works so I hope that the aesthetics of this blog will improve over time.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Computers Can Simulate Classical Computers</h2>
    <h4>14 February 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Is Quantum Computing Hard to Understand? I was very fortunate my last quarter as a graduate student at UCSD to have helped organize a quantum computing seminar. I was strongly influenced by Aaronson’s excellent book Quantum Computing Since Democritus where Aaronson’s makes a strong point that Quantum Computing is easy if you abstract away the physics. That may sound controversial but it really isn’t, do algorithmists think of the electromagnetic waves storing bits on disk...<br />

    <h2>Probability without measure theory</h2>
    <h4>14 February 2015</h4>
    <p>
      What does it mean to say \(P(event) = something \) Horse Gambling Games Way before Probability Theory was its own field let alone a field with rigorous foundations, two fairly celebrated mathematicians Pascal and Fermat wanted to win a ton of money betting on horses. Before doing so they of course had to first check whether horse gambling was a fair game. This meant they had to first define what it means for a game...<br />
