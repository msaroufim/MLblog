Hello! I'm Mark and I'm a PM at Microsoft. I work in the AI group on smart email. Before that I was a grad student at UC San Diego in ML and interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in their very first data science team and at UC Berkeley as a transportation engineer.

In my spare time, I enjoy skiing, climbing, graphic novels, board game, video games and fresh memes.
